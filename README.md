  3.**EDA**: Extensive data visualisation and summary statistics were used to extract insights and pattern from the various datasets. The history, facts and trivia behind movies were              narrated through data.\
  4.**Recommendation Systems**: This recommendation system built without the machine learning model,In this project built using only Python.\
