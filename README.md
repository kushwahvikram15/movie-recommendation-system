# Movie Recommendation-System
A `Graphical User Interface Project`,Content Based Recommender System recommends movies similar to the movie user likes and analyses.MongoDB Databsee used in this project to store user liked movie and recommended movie for user.This Project built using Tkinter GUI. A Pie Chart shows the user profile and the pie chart also visible in Tkinter. 
# Apporach
###### The Problem was divided into sevral steps:
  1. **Data Collection** : Data was collected from the default data of mflix at MongoDB DataBase and through a script that queried for Data.
  2. **Data Wrangling** : The datasets were uploaded to a dataframe and explored. Null values were filled in wherever appropriate and polluted values were discarded or wrangled.
  3. **EDA**: Extensive data visualisation and summary statistics were used to extract insights and pattern from the various datasets. The history, facts and trivia behind movies were              narrated through data.
  4. **Recommendation Systems**: This recommendation system built without the machine learning model,In this project built using only Python.
